## API Documentation
### Base URL
The API endpoints are served from the root of the application.

### Endpoints
#### POST /api/auth/[...nextauth]
**Overview**: Handles user authentication with GitHub OAuth. When a user attempts to sign in via GitHub, NextAuth processes the callback, creates or updates the user (Author) in Sanity, and establishes a session.
**Request**:
This endpoint does not expect a direct JSON payload. Authentication is managed through redirects to GitHub and subsequent callbacks. The internal process involves:
```json
{
  "provider": "github",
  "callbackUrl": "/api/auth/callback/github"
}
```
**Response**:
Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected, and a session cookie is set. Subsequent requests will include authentication information.
```json
// Example session data (accessible via GET /api/auth/session)
{
  "user": {
    "name": "GitHub User",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "image": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12345?v=4"
  },
  "expires": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "id": "author_sanity_id"
}
```
**Errors**:
-   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid OAuth state or parameters.
-   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failed (e.g., GitHub access denied).
-   `500 Internal Server Error`: Issues with NextAuth configuration or Sanity database operations during user creation/update.

#### GET /api/auth/session
**Overview**: Retrieves the current user's session information.
**Request**:
No request payload.
**Response**:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "GitHub User",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "image": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12345?v=4"
  },
  "expires": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "id": "author_sanity_id"
}
```
**Errors**:
-   `401 Unauthorized`: No active session or invalid session token.

#### GET /api/auth/csrf
**Overview**: Retrieves the Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token, essential for protecting forms against CSRF attacks.

}
```
**Errors**:
-   `500 Internal Server Error`: Problem generating the CSRF token.

#### GET /api/sentry-example-api
**Overview**: A test API endpoint designed to trigger a backend error for Sentry monitoring.
**Request**:
No request payload.
**Response**:
This endpoint is designed to throw an error, thus a successful response is not expected.
**Errors**:
-   `500 Internal Server Error`: Always returns an error as it's an example of error handling.
    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "name": "SentryExampleAPIError",
        "message": "This error is raised on the backend called by the example page."
      }
